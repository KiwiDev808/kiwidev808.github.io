		Hi there!
		<br />
		<br />
		ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lucas, a Software Engineer passionate about cloud technologies and building scalable applications.
		Currently crafting solutions at Grupo BoticÃ¡rio, where I work with cloud-native technologies and
		modern development frameworks.
		<br />
		<br />
		My journey in tech is driven by curiosity and a constant desire to learn. I love tackling complex
		challenges, especially in the AWS ecosystem, and turning them into elegant solutions. When I'm not
		coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest in cloud
		computing.
		<br />
		<br />
		Let's connect! Whether you want to discuss cloud technologies, software development, or exciting
		opportunities, feel free to reach out.
